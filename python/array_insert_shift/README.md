## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Using ‘+’ operator will make our algorithm simple and fast insted of using itteration
or recarsive algorithms but the while loop addition is optional for interactive CLI
which still linear addition to our algorithm
