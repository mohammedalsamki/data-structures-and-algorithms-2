## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

I think that the effecincy of slicing is about O(n) grade while the n is the size of
observaition that pass to algorthim which is better than using nested for loop that will
not be efficent like slicing
