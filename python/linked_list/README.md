# Reverse an Array

<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Singly Linked Lists Application for implement the Linked list in python
using Node Class

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## Linked List

- [x] Create a Linked List class
- [x] Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
- [x] The class should contain the following methods

    - [x] insert
    - [x] includes
    - [x] to string

## Test Requirements

* [x] Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
* [x] Can properly insert into the linked list
The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
* [x] Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
* [x] Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
* [x] Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
* [x] Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
