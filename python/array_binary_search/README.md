## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

    the while loop will be termneated when the lower index become higher index
    and this will casue number of operation depending on the location of the target element and the list length so it's linear O(n) notation.
