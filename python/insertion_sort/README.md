<!-- Description of the challenge -->

It's a python function takes an array and return reversed sorted array

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Time : O(N^2)

Space : O(N)

## Implementation

* [x] Provide a visual step through for each of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code
* [x] Convert the pseudo-code into working code in your language
* [x] Present a complete set of working tests

## Requirements

* [x] Ensure your complete code solution follows the standard requirements.

    - [x] Write unit tests
    - [x] Follow the template for a well-formatted README
    - [x] Submit the assignment following these instructions

## Test Requirements

* [x] Test The method by these samples:
    - [x] Reverse-sorted: [20, 18, 12, 8, 5, -2]
    - [x] Few uniques: [5, 12, 7, 5, 5, 7]
    - [x] Nearly-sorted: [2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 11]
