# Graph Depth first

## Challenge

Conduct a depth first preorder traversal on a graph

## Approach & Efficiency

- Time :
- Space :

## Feature Tasks

- [] Write the following method for the Graph class:

  - [] Name: Depth first
  - []Arguments: Node (Starting point of search)
  - [] Return: A collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order
  - [] Program output: Display the collection

## Structure and Testing

- [] Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.
