Join a tow hasmaps from left side

## Challenge

Implementation of simplified LEFT JOIN for 2 Hashmaps.

## Approach & Efficiency

Time :
Space :

## Features
* [] Write a function called left join
    - [] Arguments: two hash maps
    - [] The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
    - [] The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
    - [] Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic

## Test Requirements

* [] Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.
