# Tree FizzBuzz

## Challenge

Conducting “FizzBuzz” on a k-ary tree while traversing through it to create a new tree.

## Approach & Efficiency

## Requirements

* [x] Write a function called fizz buzz tree
    - [x] Arguments: k-ary tree
    - [x] Return: new k-ary tree
* [x] Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both.
* [x] Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
    - [x] If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
    - [x] If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
    - [x] If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
    - [x] If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

## Test Requirements

* [x] test breadth first K-ary tree
* [x] test the mutation happen when the fizz_buzz_tree function invoked on tree
* [x] test the faild state of breadth first K-ary tree creation
