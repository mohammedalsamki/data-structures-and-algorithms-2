# Quick Sort

<!-- Description of the challenge -->

a function that takes the first index and the last index and array  and return the array sorted

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Time : O(N*log(N))
Space : O(N)

## Implementation

* [x] Provide a visual step through for each of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code
* [x] Convert the pseudo-code into working code in your language
* [x] Present a complete set of working tests

## Requirements

* [x] Write unit tests

## Test Requirements

* [x] Test The method by these samples:
    - [x] Reverse-sorted: [20, 18, 12, 8, 5, -2]
    - [x] Few uniques: [5, 12, 7, 5, 5, 7]
    - [x] Nearly-sorted: [2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 11]
