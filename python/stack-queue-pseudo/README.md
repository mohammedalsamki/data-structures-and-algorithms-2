# Zip tow Linked List

<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Implement a Queue using two Stacks.

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## Requirements

* [] Create a new class called pseudo queue.

    - [] Do not use an existing Queue.
    - [] Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below),
    - [] Internally, utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue

* [] Methods:

    - [] enqueue
        Arguments: value
        Inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

    - [] dequeue
        Arguments: none
        Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.h

## Test Requirements

### Queue

    - [] Can successfully enqueue into a queue
    - [] Can successfully enqueue multiple values into a queue
    - [] Can successfully dequeue out of a queue the expected value
    - [] Can successfully peek into a queue, seeing the expected value
    - [] Can successfully empty a queue after multiple dequeues
    - [] Can successfully instantiate an empty queue
    - [] Calling dequeue or peek on empty queue raises exception
