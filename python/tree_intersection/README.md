# Tree Intersection

## Challenge

Find common values in 2 binary trees.

## Approach & Efficiency

- Time : O(N)
- Space : O(N)

## Feature Tasks


* [x] Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters.
* [x] Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.
*
## Requirements

* [x] Write unit tests
